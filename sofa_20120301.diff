-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA

-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and

-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is

-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND

-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and

-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is

-**  =====================
-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is
-**  appreciated.

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is

-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not

-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into

-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or

-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and

-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as

-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and

-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and

-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions

-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not

-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source

-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND

-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**

-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is
-**  appreciated.

-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and

-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is

-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it

-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND

-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**  =====================
-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is
-**  appreciated.

-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and

-**  =====================
-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is

-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or

-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and

-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or

-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.

-**  =====================
-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is
-**  appreciated.

-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not

-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source

-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**

-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as

-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms

-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or

-**  SOFA Software License
-**  =====================
-**
-**  NOTICE TO USER:
-**
-**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.

-**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
-**
-**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
-**
-**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
-**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
-**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
-**     restrictions listed below.
-**
-**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
-**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
-**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
-**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
-**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
-**     with the following requirements:
-**
-**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
-**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
-**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
-**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
-**        endorsed by SOFA.
-**
-**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
-**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
-**        from the original SOFA software.
-**
-**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
-**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
-**        thereof such as changes of case.
-**
-**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
-**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
-**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
-**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
-**
-**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
-**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
-**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
-**        derived work.
-**
-**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
-**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
-**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
-**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
-**     such, as explained above.
-**
-**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
-**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
-**     by inappropriate modification.
-**
-**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
-**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
-**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
-**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
-**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
-**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
-**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
-**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
-**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
-**     claim by any third party.
-**
-**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
-**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
-**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
-**     conditions.
-*
-**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
-**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is
-**  appreciated.
